Utilizing automation you are able to check if a product is in stock. You can feed it a text file containing product links and it'll get to work. I was attempting to use it to scalp RTX 3080 cards."

It is a boring old Client/Server application that utilizes a variety of features C# and .NET have to offer. Asynchronous programming, multi-threading, .NET sockets APIs. It is named Ali's Tea Shop and it was quite fun to build out. I also got a good mark!"

I used GCC for windows to compile the program, written entirely in C and using SFML library for graphics and media. I managed to get a barebones menu and a sprite moving around on the screen. Observe the GIF above for a better idea. This was also fun to make!"
